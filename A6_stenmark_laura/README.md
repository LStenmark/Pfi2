#### Comments, assignment 6

Good work, just needs some polishing.

1. UML needs some arrows of inheritance
2. Elaborate the XML-tag with sub tags
3. Done
4a. Done, the design makes the buttons barely visible
4b. Done, just check the encoding (e.g UTF-8) so the question marks dissapear. Google it.
5. Done, needs a "searching"-text while thread is running.
